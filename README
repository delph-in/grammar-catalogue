The DELPH-IN Grammar Catalogue Script

See LICENSE for copyright information.

See create-catalogue-entry.sh for package dependencies.

USAGE:

  create-catalogue-entry.sh [OPTIONS] [PATH]

  Try create-catalogue-entry.sh --help for information on OPTIONS.

  PATH is the top-level grammar directory for the grammar to catalogue.
  If unspecified, PATH is assumed to be the current directory. The top-
  level grammar directory is where the METADATA file should exist, as
  well as the canonical.bib and the lkb/ directory. Further, the
  directory should be under SVN version control for the extraction of
  version metrics.

Given a SVN-versioned grammar directory with completed METADATA and
canonical.bib files, run this command on that directory. The catalogue
information (in MoinMoin wiki or LaTeX format) will be printed to
standard output (STDOUT). This output can then be copied elsewhere.
